# Programming-Fundamentals-Project
The “**Online Out Pass Management system**”  is the foundation of this project.
These types of software are designed to cut down on paper effort, also this type of
software saves time.
This type of management system can generally reduce the amount of manual effort
required. Reduce the number of errors and help us to handle large amount of data
and easy to keep record. This program has also ability to keep the track of the
students on daily basis. It reduces the work of the warden, in such way that warden
can login anywhere and approve or reject the application of the student.
